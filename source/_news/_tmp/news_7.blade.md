title: 'CCE Grants $20,000 in COVID-19 Relief Funds to Community Partners'
body: "<p>In April, City and Community Engagement awarded over $20,000 in grant funds to our community partner organizations through the Community Service Grants initiative. These grant funds were first made available to community partners in response to the Community Advisory Board&rsquo;s request during the fall of 2017 for access to less restrictive funding to support mission-centered organizational goals.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, CCE adapted the purpose and scope of the Community Service Grants initiative to respond to the emerging challenges affecting organizations and the communities surrounding Northeastern&rsquo;s Boston campus. Applicants were asked to describe how the university&rsquo;s transition to online learning impacted their access to Northeastern human capital and physical space and thus, their ability to deliver programs and services. Applicants were also asked to demonstrate how the grant funds would be used to respond to this loss.&nbsp;</p><p>In its third year, the request for proposals generated 21 grant applications from community-based organizations and agencies that have worked in partnership with CCE during the 2019&ndash;2020 academic year. The proposals were reviewed and scored by a 10-member team of CCE staff and students. Three types of requests emerged through the grant review process: 1) funds to support the conversion of programs and services into a digital format (with costs that include staff salaries, hiring consultants, technology, and related fees); 2) funds for the purchasing of goods to meet the basic needs of community members (food, toiletries/hygiene products, baby care items) and materials needed to continue program delivery; 3) donations to newly formed emergency funds or fundraising in response to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>In total, the Community Service Grants initiative awarded $20,905 of direct funding to our partners as they continue to support their communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>2020 Community Service Grant Recipients:&nbsp;</p><p>826 Boston\nApprentice Learning\nArtists for Humanity\nBoston Housing Authority\nBoston Partners in Education\nBryce&rsquo;s Journey&nbsp;\nCatholic Charities &ndash; St. Ambrose Family Shelter&nbsp;\nCommunity Servings\nCradles to Crayons\nFriends of the Hernandez\nHuntington YMCA\nHyde Square Task Force\nLet&rsquo;s Get Ready&nbsp;\nMadison Park Community Development Corporation\nMujeres Unidas Avanzando\nNational Braille Press\nRound Table\nSherrill House\nSt. Stephen&rsquo;s Youth Programs</p>"
