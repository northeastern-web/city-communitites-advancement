body: '<p>Every summer, thousands of Boston youth participate in the city&rsquo;s<a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/youth-engagement-and-employment/successlink-jobs" title="">&nbsp;<strong>Summer Youth Employment Program</strong></a>&mdash;a program that connects teens and young adults in the city with an internship and a real income while they&rsquo;re on vacation from school.</p><p>But this spring, as businesses and organizations all over the city temporarily shuttered to prevent the spread of COVID-19, officials faced a difficult dilemma: How do you run an internship program from home?</p><p>Other cities, including<a href="https://citylimits.org/2020/08/04/summer-youth-programs-still-reeling-from-funding-cut-and-late-reversal/" title="">&nbsp;<strong>New York City</strong></a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://thedailyrecord.com/2020/07/09/for-md-young-adults-summer-jobs-internships-a-casualty-of-coronavirus/" title="">&nbsp;<strong>Baltimore</strong></a>, canceled or scaled back their youth jobs programs for the summer, leaving tens of thousands of teens and young adults without the summer jobs they were counting on&mdash;and leaving their families struggling to make up the lost income right when it was most needed. Northeastern wanted to make sure that didn&rsquo;t happen in Boston. <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/08/24/heres-how-northeastern-helped-boston-run-its-summer-jobs-program-during-the-pandemic/" title="">Read the full News@Northeastern article here! </a></p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/459476072" title="">Watch the video about Northeastern''s partnership with the City of Boston on saving the SYEP!</a></p>'
