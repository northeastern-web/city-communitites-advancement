        <p>Since 2015, we have provided individuals and groups with complimentary access to a classroom and conference room at Northeastern Crossing, 1175 Tremont Street, Boston. Advance reservations are required for both spaces. Event organizers may only host programming that is free to participants. </p>

        <div class="prose max-w-none w-full p-4 lg:w-1/2">
            <p>As you might imagine, these free spaces get reserved quickly. We recommend that you submit the online Event Space Request form as early as possible before your event. Our staff responds to these requests on a rolling basis, although we try to reply within two business days. Currently, we are fulfilling reservations up to three months in advance.</p>
            <p>The two spaces available are the conference room (capacity: 12 people) and classroom (capacity: 40 people). Both rooms have modular furniture that can be rearranged or removed as necessary. They also have overhead audio/visual equipment that can be connected to laptop computers via HDMI cables.</p>
