short_description: 'Help underserved community members receive essentials like food and medicine.'
description: '<p>LivelyHood offers free delivery of essentials like food and medicine to underserved communities in Boston. When a local community member is in need, a notification is sent out across the volunteer base. Volunteers then pick up the items. The mission is to mobilize help for vulnerable, at-risk members of the local community. In the face of COVID-19, social distancing is limiting the movement of people and changing our way of life. LivelyHood hopes to make a difference by keeping at-risk members of the community in their homes, and by asking the willing and able to run a few extra errands when they are out.</p>'
