As a supervisor, you will be taking on a leadership role within Y2Y and helping us stay open during a difficult time for people experiencing homelessness. We&rsquo;re opening up staffing opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in Boston. You do not have to be a Harvard student to apply. Supervising at Y2Y includes managing the space to help maintain safety and address needs.
