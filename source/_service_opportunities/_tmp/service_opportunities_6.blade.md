short_description: '2 Life Communities has recently launched a “Digital Library” at 2Life! 2Life residents on all five campuses can now borrow a tablet or computer as they might a library book. '
description: '<p>Residents participating in the &quot;Digital Library Program&quot;  as well as residents with their own devices are eager to learn how to use the technology as a tool to connect with family and friends and to generate new connections through our virtual program offerings. 2Life is actively recruiting new volunteers to support our virtual programs.</p><p>2 Life Communities is actively recruiting and prioritizing these virtual positions:</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tech Tutor (English,&nbsp;Cantonese, Russian, Korean and Spanish speakers): 2Life is in need of volunteers to help build residents&rsquo; confidence in navigating new technology. Volunteers are matched with resident(s) in need of extra tech support. Residents can borrow tablets and computers from 2Life&rsquo;s new Device Library and attend an array of virtual programming offered by 2Life. However, many residents are unable to participate fully in the programming because they are still learning how to use their tablet or computer. Tech Tutors are not expected to solve every tech related issue, they are expected to try their best!</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn to Zoom Support (Cantonese, Russian, Korean and Spanish speakers): 2Life is in need of volunteers to support a Learn to Zoom course in Cantonese, Russian, Korean and Spanish. The course will be for residents who want to&nbsp;learn&nbsp;how to use&nbsp;Zoom&nbsp;and get comfortable with this very useful program so that they may participate in 2Life&rsquo;s virtual program offerings. In addition to learning concrete computer skills, there will be a social component where volunteers, staff and residents will have a good time getting to know each other and build friendships.&nbsp;</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;English Conversationalist (bilingual in Russian and English ideally): <strong>:</strong>&nbsp;2Life is in need of volunteers to attend an English Conversation Club once a week. The course will be for 2Life residents who want to&nbsp;practice their English. In addition to practicing conversational English, residents will also learn concrete computer skills by using Zoom as the means of connection/conversation. Topics of conversation will change week to week and will be determined informally by the group.&nbsp;</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual Armchair Travel Guide: 2Life is in need of volunteers to contribute to the Virtual Armchair Travel Series. The series will operate as a live Zoom meeting for residents to view and participate. Each session a [group of] volunteer[s] will lead the resident participants through a virtual tour of a predetermined location. Residents will follow along as a volunteer(s) gives a virtual tour. The tours could take place at the volunteer&rsquo;s college campus, a local museum, an organic farm or a historical sight. The possibilities are endless!&nbsp;</p>'
