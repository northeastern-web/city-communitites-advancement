description: '<p>Boston Housing Authority&rsquo;s Volunteer Interpreters Program (VIP) was piloted in the fall of 2010 by the <a href="https://www.bostonhousing.org/en/Center-for-Community-Engagement/Language-Access-Division.aspx" title="">Language Access Division</a>, now under the <a href="https://www.bostonhousing.org/en/Center-for-Community-Engagement.aspx" title="">Center for Community Engagement and Civil Rights</a>. VIP has since expanded BHA&rsquo;s language resources to 25 languages and it is instrumental in providing interpretation and translation services for BHA&rsquo;s clients during appointments, community meetings and phone calls, to ensure that families who speak limited English have access to BHA&rsquo;s services. There are three upcoming training sessions for volunteer interpreters in August, September, and October.</p><p>To sign up to volunteer and attend the training sessions, use <a href="https://www.bostonhousing.org/BHA/media/Documents/CCECR/03_Application-form_FIN_1112013_FIN_1242014.pdf" title=""><u>this link</u></a>.</p>'
