description: '<p>South End Soccer was founded in 2008 to bring together youth from Boston neighborhoods such as the South End, Roxbury, and Chinatown to play the beautiful game, develop a love of the sport, and build community. We do more than just play a sport; we connect our diverse community, forge relationships, and create opportunity and equity. We have many volunteer opportunities, including administrative, development, fundraising, coaching, and more. We play on Carter Field on Columbus Avenue, and other fields in Roxbury and the South End. Depending on the role, you could be helping on or off the field.</p><p>To Participate please email your name, year in school, major, where you are from, a brief paragraph about your interests and prior work or volunteer experiences, and what you love most about Boston or Northeastern. Please also include the weeks/dates over the next six to nine months that you can work 4&ndash;20 hours virtually or in person.</p>'
