description: "<p>The Winter Walk is a 2 mile march through the streets of Boston during one the coldest month of the winter, shoulder to shoulder as a housed and unhoused community. Following the Walk, participants gather on Copley Plaza for a breakfast and to hear stories. All event volunteers will have the opportunity to join the community breakfast at the end of the Walk and engage with both Walk participants and homeless attendees, while still getting to learn about all the amazing partner organizations. \n The hope for 2021 is to hold an in-person, live event that is safe and follows Covid-19 protocols. We will also host a virtual event. The event is suitable for all ages - bring the whole family and help build the next generation of social justice warriors! We welcome individuals, families, and groups.  Anyone under 18 will need to be accompanied by an adult guardian or school/program chaperone who has been given permission to oversee youth.  </p>"
