Help with setup, cleanup, managing lines, and supporting vendors in a friendly and fun outdoor space. We ask for a minimum of a two-hour shift but you are welcome to fill multiple shifts in one day. We&rsquo;re only a few miles from Northeastern&rsquo;s campus and one mile from the Forest Hills T stop. We hope you''ll join us as we work to serve our community in a safe and healthy way!</p><p>If this is your first time volunteering with Roslindale Village Main Street, please email <a href="mailto:marketvolunteers@roslindale.net" title=""><u>marketvolunteers@roslindale.net</u></a></p>'
