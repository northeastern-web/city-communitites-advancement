short_description: 'Language Accessibility of Northeastern COVID-19 Guidelines (LANG) is seeking translators'
description: '<p>The LANG Initiative (Language Accessibility of Northeastern COVID-19 Guidelines) is a coalition of Northeastern students and faculty whose goal is to translate vital university administrative and emergency websites into the major languages spoken on campus. Through language accessibility, we aim to provide all Northeastern students and their families with the resources needed to make informed decisions concerning fall semester attendance, emergency situations, and students&rsquo; mental and physical well-being. Working groups will be composed of Northeastern students who are fluent speakers in their respective language. Website responsibilities will be delegated among the student translators. After two rounds of revisions, a bilingual faculty member will act as an editor to issue a final approval of the translated literature.</p><p>To register to be a LANG translator, use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-WZcK_PtAWwDwLaklrdPrN18cBZrsP9aKplxENHx31NaBpQ/viewform" title=""><u>this link</u></a>.</p>'
