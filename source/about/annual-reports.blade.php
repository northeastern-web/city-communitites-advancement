        <p>Each year, our office of City and Community Engagement compiles information from across Northeastern to include in the Community Benefits Annual Report. The CBAR contains information about Northeasternâ€™s commitments in local neighborhoods, progress reports on construction projects, and data on hiring practices. The report is required by the Boston Planning and Development Authority and is released annually in December. </p>
