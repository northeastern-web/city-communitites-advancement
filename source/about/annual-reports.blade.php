        <p>Each year, our office of City and Community Engagement compiles information from across Northeastern to include in the Community Benefits Annual Report. The CBAR contains information about Northeastern’s commitments in local neighborhoods, progress reports on construction projects, and data on hiring practices. The report is required by the Boston Planning and Development Authority and is released annually in December. </p>
        <p>CCE compiles another annual report highlighting our office’s work and its impact in and around Boston. Although this report has some overlapping information with the CBAR, it contains more information about our staff and includes comments from our partners and program participants. </p>
