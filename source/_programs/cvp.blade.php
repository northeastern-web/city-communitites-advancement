Family Gym is a free, weekly fitness and play class that provides families with children ages 3 to 8 with a safe, accessible space to engage in creative, fun, and age-appropriate physical activity. Educational activities focused on healthy eating are also featured on a regular basis, and community organizations bring resources around food, financial literacy, and wellness to Family Gym each week for participants. Family Gym activities are facilitated by volunteers from Northeastern University, creating valuable engagement and understanding between Boston’s college student population and its residents. Family Gym is able to provide valuable health and wellness opportunities for underserved populations, preventing childhood obesity, providing a safe space for families to be active, and connecting participants to valuable resources that might not have been previously accessible.</p>
                    <p>This semester, Family Gym seeks volunteers to develop and create content that can be shared with youth and families in a virtual context. Volunteers can select from a variety of content types that align with the mission and goals of Family Gym such as: park tours, read alouds, exercise tutorials, and cooking videos. Volunteers will work asynchronously throughout the semester to create approximately 1 new piece of content each week throughout the program with ongoing support from the Family Gym team. There may also be opportunities to connect and lead live sessions with BCYF Family Gym participants throughout the semester.</p>
