Northeastern students volunteer with community organizations—in the U.S. and around the world—that address critical social issues, such as affordable housing, environmental conservation, youth education, and sustainable agriculture. Through meaningful action, reflection, and education, our volunteers explore new places and cultures, work with people from different communities, and build problem-solving and leadership skills for the future.</p>

        <h3>Travel and accommodations</h3>
        <p>For ASB trips outside Boston, volunteers will fly to their destinations via Logan International Airport. Volunteers for local and regional trips will drive to the host site. Teams travel together, leaving February 29 and returning March 7.</p>
        <p>Once on-site, ground transportation will be provided. Some vehicles will be driven by staff and students older than 21 who have been certified by Northeastern. For global trips, the host organization will coordinate transportation.</p>
        <p>Volunteers stay in modest housing at community centers, churches, hostels, camp facilities, or Airbnbs. Team Leaders will provide detailed packing lists prior to departure based on your trip and its accommodations.</p>
        <h3>Zero-tolerance policy</h3>
        <p>ASB participants are not permitted to consume alcohol or drugs at any time on ASB trips regardless of the laws in the host state or country. Any participant that violates this zero-tolerance policy will be asked to leave the trip at their own expense. </p>
        <h3>Safety and emergency response</h3>
        <p>We carefully vet our host sites to verify that they do meaningful work and can provide a safe environment for ASB teams. We work closely with Northeastern’s risk management and legal departments to ensure host sites are in compliance with university policies. We also monitor travel advisories from the State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure volunteer safety.</p>
        <p>In the event of a medical, security, political, or other emergency, ASB participants will immediately notify Northeastern’s Office of City and Community Engagement. Northeastern employs Aon WorldAware as a travel assistance and response provider, and Aon and Northeastern will work to facilitate the appropriate response. In an emergency scenario, every reasonable accommodation will be made to ensure the safety of ASB participants and get them back to Boston quickly. Unfortunately, we cannot offer a refund of trip fees. Learn more about <a href="https://www.aon.com/risk-services/worldaware/default.jsp">Aon WorldAware</a>.</p>
