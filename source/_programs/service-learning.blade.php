        <p class="lead">Service-Learning is a form of experiential learning for students and a teaching tool for faculty that combines academics and service to meet educational and community goals. Students and faculty work with community organizations, nonprofit groups, and government agencies to reinforce and build upon concepts learned in the classroom.</p>
        <h2>Program Details</h2>
        <h3>Courses</h3>
        <p>Northeastern offers more than 100 service-learning course sections taught by 60+ faculty members across eight colleges each academic year.</p>

        <p>Wondering what a service-learning course looks like in practice? Here’s just one example:</p>
        <p><a href="https://slogatnu.com/2018/04/02/capturingcommunity-cassandra-barrett/">Cassandra</a> took Inquiries in Biology with a service-learning component in her second year. This course focused on providing an overview of neurobiology and stem cells, two exciting and complex scientific fields. In addition to studying the scientific breakthroughs and ethical debates surrounding stem cells, Cassandra partnered with United South End Settlements (a short 10-minute walk from her residence hall). At USES, Cassandra led after-school workshops for elementary schoolers once a week, with lesson plans she and other students designed based on their coursework that were accessible and fun for children. Cassandra enjoyed getting to see her students’ interest in science grow as the workshops continued. Through this experience, Cassandra realized her passion for education equity and social justice. This has led her to further explore this passion through a teaching-based co-op and by becoming a service-learning teaching assistant.</p>

        <h3>Community partners</h3>
        <p>We partner on service-learning courses with a variety of community-based organizations, nonprofits, government agencies, and schools. View a full list of our current and prior <a href="/about/partners">community partners</a>.</p>
        <h3>Course design and development</h3>
        <h4>Getting started</h4>
        <p>When designing S-L courses and experiences, we start with two questions: (1) What do faculty want or need their students to learn in the course? and (2) What are the goals and interests of our community partners?</p>
        <p>Faculty members can incorporate a service or community engagement component into a new course they are creating or integrate it into an existing course. Follow these steps to get started:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Complete the <a href="https://rise.articulate.com/share/q2b4E2aUpgbiuuM7N2xD6qp_lQb-jq8J#/">self-guided onboarding module</a>, which takes about 30-45 minutes to complete. The module explains how faculty members can partner with and become a part of the Service-Learning Program at Northeastern, and it serves as  a one-stop-shop resource to explore the program’s resources, philosophies, and processes. At the end you will be prompted to fill out a form and download a set of questions to reflect on your course.</li>
            <li>Email <a href="mailto:service-learning@northeastern.edu">service-learning@northeastern.edu</a> to set up a time to meet with a member of the Community-Engaged Teaching and Research team.</li>
            <li>Meet with a member of the Community-Engaged Teaching and Research team to discuss your ideas. Please bring a copy of your reflection responses from the onboarding module.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Find more information and resources on our <a href="https://nuslfacultyinfo.wordpress.com/">Service-Learning Faculty Resources</a> webpage.</p>
        <h4>Course criteria</h4>
        <p>Service-Learning courses can be structured many different ways. However, all Northeastern service-learning courses include core elements: integrated learning, collaboration, quality service, reflection, assessment and evaluation, and civic engagement and responsibility. The self-guided onboarding module discusses this in more depth, but each of these elements should be present in your course design.</p>
        <p>Adding a service-learning component to your course may make it eligible to be designated with various attributes in Banner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>‘NUpath Integrating Knowledge and Skills through Experiences’ Attribute: Four-credit undergraduate courses where S-L is a requirement and a substantial part of the course may be eligible to receive this attribute. CCE will send a list of approved courses to the Office of the Provost and Office of the Registrar to be appropriately marked in Banner for student records. Faculty do not need to apply to the University Undergraduate Curriculum Committee separately.</li>
            <li>‘With Service-Learning’ Attribute: All courses that require an S-L component will automatically be tagged with this attribute in Banner after the semester has started. This allows our program to partner with Institutional Research and Decision Support to explore patterns and trends of student data and experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Faculty resources</h4>
        <p>On our <a href="https://nuslfacultyinfo.wordpress.com/">Faculty Resources</a> page, we have curated many resources to help faculty develop and implement S-L courses, including best practices, nationally recognized theory and research, and the accumulated wisdom of Northeastern S-L faculty and staff. Below is a sample of the resources you’ll find there:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://nuslfacultyinfo.wordpress.com/home/coursedesign/">Course and syllabus design</a>, including reflection, grading, and student accountability</li>
            <li><a href="https://nuslfacultyinfo.wordpress.com/home/preparing-students-for-service/">Preparing students for service</a></li>

        </ul>
        <p>In addition, faculty can find several resources through the following professional associations, academic journals, and Northeastern campus partners:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.researchslce.org/">International Association for Research on Service-Learning and Community Engagement </a></li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Assessment and evaluation</h3>
        <p>Assessment of service-learning is a collaborative process intended to demonstrate that course-community partnerships meet both course and community goals.</p>
        <p>As in any course, S-L students are graded for their learning and ability to meet course objectives, not for their service. Reflective course assignments and exercises connect academic content and service and allow students to demonstrate what they’ve learned. Community partners can also help evaluate whether S-L students fulfilled service objectives.</p>

        <h3>Students</h3>
        <h4>Service-Learning Students</h4>
        <p>Service-Learning students are undergraduate and graduate students who are enrolled in one of the 100+ service-learning courses at Northeastern. [link to course list information 1.72 C]</p>
        <h4>Service-Learning Teaching Assistants</h4>
        <p>S-LTAs are students who act as a liaison and resource for S-L campus and community partners. The S-LTA program has five goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Training and supporting student S-LTAs to develop their leadership skills</li>
            <li>Assisting faculty members to implement the best practices of S-L in their courses</li>
            <li>Supporting community partners to help ensure partnership goals are met through student and faculty engagement</li>
            <li>Aiding student service-learners in meeting their academic and service requirements and commitments</li>
            <li>Serving as an extension of service-learning staff to facilitate a quality program that is academically rigorous and socially and ethically responsible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>S-LTAs are typically assigned to a single course, and therefore support a specific faculty member, cohort of students, and one or more community partnerships throughout the semester. In many ways, S-LTAs act as a project manager and logistics coordinator for the course and associated partnerships as a way to foster the principles of community engagement in the course.</p>
        <p>S-LTAs spend 7–10 hours per week on their role, including time in the classroom. Both undergraduate and graduate students can apply. View a full job description, compensation details, and qualification information <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_8i41RO70II-X_axEzy2n_ZlVy0ZcrA4TXzVAq6bSSU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Apply here. [add link to Apply section]</p>
        <h4>Service-Learning Street Team</h4>
        <p>The Service-Learning Street Team is a team of undergraduate and graduate students who support the program by (1) leading community walks for Northeastern faculty, staff, and students, (2) accompanying S-L students to their orientation or first day of service, and (3) extending the marketing and outreach capacity of the Community-Engaged Teaching and Research team on campus, in the community, and through social media.</p>
        <p>Street Team members spend 3–7 hours per week on their role. View a full job description, compensation details, and qualification information <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wfmNIR-HbyDYLUWMeiHQ3N0xICKOpAq3TL830ItyHU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Apply here. [link to Apply section]</p>
        <h4>Service-Learning Team Managers</h4>
        <p>The Service-Learning Team Manager (S-LTM) program offers an advanced leadership opportunity for previous service-learning student leaders (S-LTAs and Street Team). S-LTMs are upper-level students who manage a cohort of five to twelve S-LTAs or Street Team members and act as their primary advisor and manager.</p>
        <p>S-LTMs spend 10–15 hours per month on their role, in addition to their work as S-LTAs or Street Team members. View a full job description, compensation details, and qualification information <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XVnTfzNGvQrU9xdfW6nLuAMT0vh_P6ubWuaoAJQvt9w/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Team Managers are selected each semester by the Director and Assistant Director of Community-Engaged Teaching and Research. We give consideration to all returning S-L student leaders each semester and invite those who have demonstrated their potential for an advanced leadership position, represent diverse academic areas, and have shown a deep understanding of the philosophies and principles of service-learning and community engagement.</p>
        <h3>Community Partners</h3>
        <p>We partner with community-based organizations, nonprofits, government agencies, and schools across the City of Boston. View a list of our current and prior community partners here. [add link to Community Partners page]</p>
        <p>Many of our partnerships are initiated through a Request for Partnerships process in the months before an academic semester starts. The purpose of the RFP process is to identify the goals of community-based organizations so that we can best connect them with S-L faculty and courses.</p>

        <h3>Community Partners</h3>
        <p>Many of our partnerships with community-based organizations, nonprofits, government agencies, and schools are initiated through a Request for Partnerships process. The purpose of the RFP process is to identify the goals of community-based organizations so that we can best connect them with S-L faculty and courses.</p>
        <p>The RFP process for 2019–2020 courses is closed. RFP documents for organizations interested in partnering with us in 2020–2021 will be posted here in May 2020.</p>
