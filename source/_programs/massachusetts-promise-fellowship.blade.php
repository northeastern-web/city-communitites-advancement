        <p class="lead">We believe young people need five key resources to succeed in life: caring adults, a safe place, a healthy start, a quality education, and an opportunity to serve. Each year, Massachusetts Promise Fellowship (MPF) trains 40 people to provide those five resources to youth across the Commonwealth. These Fellows—typically recent college graduates—work at non­profit organizations, schools, and government agencies to lead out­-of­-school-time programs for 3,000+ Massachusetts youth annually in grades 6–12. Our paid Fellows provide mentoring, college and career readiness, and academic enrichment.</p>
        <p class="lead">MPF is an AmeriCorps program hosted by Northeastern’s Office of City and Community Engagement and supported by the Massachusetts Service Alliance and the Corporation for National and Community Service.</p>

                    <p>Massachusetts Promise Fellows receive career coaching and more than 170 hours of training in leadership, social justice, youth development, and other subjects. See more in the Training and Leadership Development section.</p>
                    <p>Fellows are also eligible to take free courses at Northeastern University’s College of Professional Studies during their service year. They can choose from in-person evening classes or online courses, in undergraduate studies, graduate studies, or continuing education.</p>
                    <p>From 2007–2019, 315 Fellows have taken courses at CPS. Forty-seven Fellows have received graduate certificates and 39 have received master’s degrees.</p>
                    <p>Upon successful completion of a year of service with MPF, Fellows are also eligible for a 25% discount on CPS courses for up to seven years after their service.</p>
                    <p>Fellows who are interested in pursuing classes while completing a year of service are required to apply to CPS for admission. For more information, visit the <a href="https://cps.northeastern.edu/">CPS website</a>.</p>

                <div class="prose max-w-3xl">
                    <p>MPF’s training curriculum, networking opportunities, and career coaching help Fellows build the skills to succeed in the private and public sector after their MPF service. Many alumni continue their careers in the MPF network. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Half of all Fellows complete a second year in the program.</li>
                            <li>On average, 25% of Fellows are hired by their host site for full-time employment after their year of service.</li>
                            <li>21 alumni are currently employed by host sites in our 2020–2021 program.</li>

            <x-kernl-accordion.item title="Pay and financial assistance">
                <div class="prose max-w-3xl">
                    <p>For a year of service, Fellows receive:</p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Taxable stipend of up to $15,500</li>
                            <li>Segal AmeriCorps Education Award of up to $6,195</li>
                            <li>$60 monthly transportation allowance (for gas or an MBTA pass)</li>
                            <li>Health insurance</li>
                            <li>Loan forbearance for government loans</li>
                            <li>Public service loan forgiveness</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To live on the $15,500 stipend, many Fellows take part-time jobs, live with roommates, and find ways to earn extra income. Because Fellows receive a stipend and not a wage, they qualify for public assistance. Many take advantage of this benefit and receive SNAP benefits (also known as food stamps) and/or fuel assistance during the service year. MPF supports Fellows in accessing public assistance programs and benefits.</p>
                    <p>The Segal AmeriCorps Education Award is a post-service benefit earned by individuals who complete an approved term of national service in an AmeriCorps program such as MPF. MPF Fellows receive this award once they successfully complete 1,700 hours in the program.</p>
                    <p>The award may be used to pay for educational expenses at eligible post-secondary institutions, including many technical schools and G.I. Bill-approved programs, or to repay qualified student loans. The dollar amount of the education award is equal to the maximum amount of the U.S. Department of Education Pell Grant and may change year to year.</p>

        <h3>Training and Leadership Development</h3>
        <p>MPF is committed to the personal and professional development of our Fellows. We offer training in three areas: developing skills related to working with young people, building professional competencies, and growing as a culturally responsive educator. In addition, MPF launches a “Life After AmeriCorps” Series each year focused on the next steps for Fellows.</p>
        <h4>Monthly development trainings</h4>
        <p>Fellows convene monthly for training, team-building, and networking. The purpose of these meetings is to provide a community of support and to prepare Fellows for delivering MPF’s Five Promises to youth. Trainers include fellowship staff, fellowship alumni, Northeastern University staff, community partners, and external consultants.</p>

                    <p>Host sites know best the skills that a Fellow will need to succeed in a particular role. MPF therefore allows host sites to take the lead in the recruitment and screening process. MPF helps advertise the fellowship positions, assist in the interview process, and handle the hiring of the Fellow with the host site’s approval.</p>
